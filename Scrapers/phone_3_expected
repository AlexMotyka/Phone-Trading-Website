{'SELLTYPE': u'FIXED', 'DESCRIPTION': u'So long story short I\u2019m looking to sell my mother\u2019s unlocked iPhone X she doesn\u2019t apple and decided to go with Android the phone is practically brand new! The only problem is my little brother decided to color on the box with a sharpie (he\u2019s 4) so yeah phone is basically brand new comes with all accessories just no box that\u2019s why the price is lower than what I would originally post it for. If you really want a box I do have a box that I can give you that would work for the phone since I work at a box store lol We can meet at any apple store and you can the verify imei and that the phone is good to go and is flawless not a scratch or mark or anything!
